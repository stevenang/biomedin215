def summarize_icd9(
    diagnoses: pd.DataFrame,
    subject_ids: List[int],
    indicator_column_name: str,
    icd9_prefix_list: str,
) -> pd.DataFrame:
    """
    Returns a DataFrame containing only the columns `subject_id`, `hadm_id`, and
    `<indicator_column_name>` where each row is a unique (`subject_id`, `hadm_id`)
    pair and <indicator_column_name> is 1 if the patient has an ICD-9 code that
    starts with ANY of the ICD-9 code prefixes provided, and 0 otherwise.

    The diagnoses DataFrame contains ICD-9 codes for ALL admissions for
    ALL patients in the MIMIC-III database. Use the `subject_ids` parameter
    to restrict the diagnoses DataFrame to only the subject_ids that appear
    in the `subject_ids` parameter. (This will reduce the size of the DataFrame
    and speed up your code.)

    Each unique (`subject_id`, `hadm_id`) pair will correspond to one or more
    rows in the diagnoses DataFrame, where each row contains a ICD-9 code for that
    (`subject_id`, `hadm_id`) pair.

    For each (`subject_id`, `hadm_id`) pair, determine whether or not the patient
    has any ICD-9 codes that start with ANY of the ICD-9 code prefixes provided
    above. If the patient has an ICD-9 code that starts with ANY of the ICD-9 code
    prefixes provided above, then the <indicator_column_name> should be 1 for that
    (`subject_id`, `hadm_id`) pair. If the patient does NOT have an ICD-9 code that
    starts with ANY of the ICD-9 code prefixes provided above, then the
    <indicator_column_name> should be 0 for that (`subject_id`, `hadm_id`) pair.

    EXAMPLE: If one of the ICD-9 codes in the `icd9_code` column for a given
    (`subject_id`, `hadm_id`) pair is "11511", then the patient has an infection
    because "11511" starts with "115" which is one of the ICD-9 code prefixes
    provided above.

    For all subject_id's in the `subject_id_list` parameter, the final output
    DataFrame should contain a single row for each unique (`subject_id`, `hadm_id`)
    pair, and a column `<indicator_column_name>` which is 1 if the patient has an
    an ICD-9 code with a prefix from the sets above and 0 otherwise.

    IMPLEMENTATION INSTRUCTIONS:
        - Complete the function below (where indicated) to return a new DataFrame
            that contains ONLY the columns `subject_id`, `hadm_id`, and
            `<indicator_column_name>`, such that each row is a unique
            (`subject_id`, `hadm_id`) pair has an `<indicator_column_name>` that
            is 1 if the patient has a relevant ICD-9 code and 0 otherwise.
        - First, use the `subject_ids` parameter to restrict the diagnoses DataFrame
            to only the subject_ids that appear in the `subject_ids` list.
        - A patient should be considered to have an infection if any of the corresponding
            ICD-9 codes in the `icd9_code` column start with ANY of the relevant ICD-9 code
            prefixes.
        - Consider any row of the original DataFrame to NOT indicate an the presence of
            a relevant ICD-9 code if the `icd9_code` column is null. Examples:
                - if a patient has code that starts with one of the ICD-9 code prefixes
                provided above AND also has null code for a particular (`subject_id`, `hadm_id`)
                pair, then the `<indicator_column_name>` for that (`subject_id`, `hadm_id`)
                should be considered to correspond to an infection.
                - If a patient only has null codes for a particular (`subject_id`, `hadm_id`)
                pair, then that (`subject_id`, `hadm_id`) should NOT correspond
                to an infection.
        - Do NOT modify the input DataFrame.
        - No other error checking is required.

    HINTS:
        - Your implementation should utilize the pandas groupby function.
        - You may find the pandas.Series.str.startswith function useful.
        - You may find the pandas.Series.fillna function useful.

    Parameters:
        diagnoses (pd.DataFrame): A DataFrame containing the columns
            `subject_id`, `hadm_id`, and `icd9_code`.
        subject_ids (List[int]): A list of subject_ids to restrict the diagnoses
            DataFrame to.
        indicator_column_name (str): The name of the column that indicates whether
            or not the patient has an infection. (TODO: Your implementation should
            use the value of this parameter to name the column that indicates whether
            or not the patient has a relevant ICD9.)
        icd9_prefix_list (str): A string name of the ICD-9 code prefixes to use
            when determining whether or not a patient has an infection. (This is
            only for selecting the appropriate ICD-9 code prefixes, which is
            taken care of for you. You should not use the parameter directly.)

    Returns:
        icd9_df (pd.DataFrame): A DataFrame containing the columns
            `subject_id`, `hadm_id`, and `has_infection`, such that each row
            is a unique (`subject_id`, `hadm_id`) pair and `has_infection` is 1
            if the patient has an infection and 0 otherwise.

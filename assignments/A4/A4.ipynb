This is where `Information Content (IC)` comes into play:\n",

    "Another concern is that when monitoring patients, especially when thinking about heart rate recordings, relying on a single data point can be misleading. By merely using the last recorded value, we run the risk of using an atypical value. Imagine a scenario where a patient's heart rate is regularly around 80 beats per minute, but due to some temporary distress or a device error, the last recorded value spikes to 120 bpm. If we base our analysis or decisions on this single data point, our conclusions will be skewed.\n",
    "\n",
    "To address these concerns, instead of using just the last measurement, we can utilize a more robust metric: the time-weighted average heart rate. The idea behind a time-weighted average is to account for all measurements while giving more weight to recent ones. This ensures that:\n",
    "- All data points contribute to the final value.\n",
    "- More recent data has a higher influence on the average, as it might be more relevant to the patient's current state.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the formula $w = e^{(-|\\Delta t| - 1)}$ to calculate the weights of each measurement, where $\\Delta t$ is the time difference between the measurement time and the cutoff time in hours. \n",
    "\n",
    "Calculate the weighted average for each patient with the formula $\\bar{x}_w = \\sum(x_i w_i)/\\sum(w_i)$, where $x_i$ is the value of the measurement and $w_i$ is the weight of that measurement, and $i$ ranges from 1 to the total number of measurements for that patient.\n",
    "\n",
    "The result should be a dataframe with two columns: `subject_id` and `time_wt_avg`. Implement the function `get_time_weighted_hr` in `src/vitals.py` to calculate the time-weighted average heart rate for each patient, following the instructions in the docstring. When you are done, run the cell below to sanity check your implementation."

To test the skills you've learned thus far, you now have free rein to get creative and derive whatever additional features you would like and use them alongside the disease, text and vitals features as input to a simple classifier. To help you with your task, we provide you with CSV files for ALL of the tables in MIMIC III where each table has been filtered to contain only the records for the patients in our small cohort.

    "In part 1 and part 2 of this assigment, we developed the features based on the following:\n",

    "* Count of past diagnosis code in 6 months prior index time using the highly specific ICD-9 codes with IC between 4 - 9 (inclusive)\n",
    "* using `Notes` to search terms related to inflammatory disorder with current admission notes\n",
    "* Using `Vitals` to get the latest heart rates for a patient and tie weighted the heart rate among all admission for the patient \n",
    "\n",
    "Using these features, the mean ROC AUC score was 0.5389.\n",
    "\n",
    "To develop predictive features, I leveraged established clinical knowledge about sepsis diagnosis and treatment, focusing on indicators that provide the most specific and meaningful signals for septic shock prediction. These features were engineered using the following clinical criteria (with detailed calculations provided in the sections above):\n",
    "\n",
    "* Age: Given that populations with compromised immune systems, particularly newborns and the elderly, face higher risks of developing sepsis and septic shock, this feature captures the patient's age at the time of admission when shock_label was determined\n",
    "\n",
    "* Related vitals: Beyond heart rate, there are several vital signs serve as indicators of impending septic shock, including temperature abnormalities and blood pressure fluctuations. We therefore engineered features capturing both the latest measurements and time-weighted values of body temperature and systolic blood pressure leading up to the index time.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Related microbial test results: Since sepsis represents an extreme immune response to infection, microbial infection data can be valuable predictors of septic shock. We therefore developed features that count distinct infectious organisms identified in blood and urine cultures.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Prescription: Key medications in sepsis treatment include vasopressors (vasopressin/norepinephrine) for maintaining organ perfusion and insulin for managing stress-induced hyperglycemia. We developed features that calculate the mean prescription frequency of these medications leading up to the index time.\n",
    "\n",
    "* ICU stays: We calculated two ICU-related metrics per patient: the average number of ICU admissions and the mean ICU length of stay (in fractional days). Frequent or prolonged ICU stays may indicate immune system compromise, potentially increasing the risk of septic shock in subsequent hospitalizations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before adding these features, the mean ROC AUC Score was 0.538. After adding the new features to the training process, the mean ROC AUC score raised to 0.7012. The new features increased performance of the classifier, and suggests that they are information-rich features that heavily impacted the model for septic shock predictions.\n",

def filter_by_chartdate(

) -> pd.DataFrame:
    """
    Filters the notes dataframe to only include notes that have a chartdate
    prior to the index_time for patient.

    IMPLEMENTATION INSTRUCTIONS:
        - Return a filtered version of the notes dataframe (with the same
            columns) that only contains notes that have a chartdate prior to
            the day of the index_time for the patient.
        - Drop the "index_time" and "label" columns from the dataframe before
            returning
        - Do not modify the input dataframe.

    Parameters:
        - shock_labels: dataframe containing the index_time and label for each
            patient
        - notes: dataframe containing all of the notes for each patient

def merge_snomed(
    snomed_ct_isaclosure: pd.DataFrame, snomed_ct_str_cui: pd.DataFrame
) -> pd.DataFrame:
    """
    Merge the snomed_ct_isaclosure and snomed_ct_str_cui dataframes to create a
    dataframe that contains a row for the CUIs and all of their descendant terms.
    In other words, the dataframe will contain 1 or more rows for each CUI such
    that each CUI is in a row with each of its descendant terms.

    EXAMPLE:
        - snomed_ct_isaclosure contains ancestor descendant pairs for each CUI
        - snomed_ct_str_cui contains the CUI and the term each CUI represents
        - The resulting dataframe should contain two columns: `cui` and `term`
            where the `cui` column represents the CUI and the `term` column
            represents a descendant term for the CUI. There should be one or more
            rows for each CUI, but each row (CUI, term) pair should be unique.


    IMPLEMENTATION INSTRUCTIONS:
        - Perform the appropriate merge operation to create a dataframe that
            contains a row for each descendant and the corresponding ancestor
            and term.
        - The resulting dataframe should have the following columns:
            - `cui`: represents the 'ancestor', which is the unique identifier
                    for each concept.
            - `term`: represents the 'str', which is the term for the concept.
        - Do not modify the input dataframes.

    Parameters:
        - snomed_ct_isaclosure: dataframe containing ancestor descendant pairs
            for each CUI
        - snomed_ct_str_cui: dataframe containing the CUI and the term each CUI
            represents

    """
    Returns a list of terms that are descendants of the cui (passed in via the
    parameter) where the term string is shorter than or equal to the character
    limit. The returned list should be sorted primarily by the length of the term
    string in ascending order and then alphabetically for terms with the same length.

    IMPLEMENTATION INSTRUCTIONS:
        - Create a list of terms that are descendants of the CUI that are shorter
            than or equal to the character limit.
        - Return the list of terms sorted primarily by the length of the term
            string (in ascending order) and then alphabetically for terms with the
            same length.
        - Ensure that the returned list does not contain any duplicate terms.
        - Do not modify the input dataframe.

    Parameters:
        - snomed_ct_concept_string: dataframe containing a row for each descendant

def extract_terms(

) -> pd.DataFrame:
    """
    Determines if any of the terms in the term_list are found in the notes
    dataframe. Returns a dataframe containing all of the columns in the notes_filtered
    dataframe and an additional column terms in the term_list that indicate
    whether or not the term was found in the note with a boolean value.

    If the term_limit paramter `IS` None, then the function should use all terms
    in the term_list.

    If the term_limit parameter is `NOT` None, then the function should use the first
    <term_limit> terms in the term_list.


    IMPLEMENTATION INSTRUCTIONS:
        - Return a dataframe containing all of the columns in the notes_filtered
            dataframe and an additional column for each term in the term_list (
            up to term_limit if specified) that inddicates whether or not the
            term was found in the note with a boolean value.
        - Do not modify the input dataframe.

    Parameters:
        - notes_filtered: dataframe containing only notes that have a chartdate
            prior to the day of the index_time for the patient
        - term_list: list of terms to search for in the notes dataframe
        - term_limit: the maximum number of terms to use from the term_list. If
            None, then use all terms in the term_list. Default: None

    HINT:
        - Your implementation should utilize the str.contains method to determine
            if a term is in a note. This method can be used on a pandas series
            in a vectorized fashion.
        - We highly recommend that you create a temporary dataframe to store
            the columns for each term and then utilize the pd.concat method to
            add the columns to the nx_terms dataframe. This will be much faster
            than adding a column to the nx_terms dataframe at each iteration of
            the for loop.

    Returns:
        - nx_terms: dataframe containing all of the columns in the notes_filtered
            dataframe and an additional column for each term in the term_list that
            inddicates whether or not the term was found in the note with a boolean

def normalize_terms(

    """
    Normalizes the nx_terms dataframe by converting the term column to the CUI
    for each term. Returns a dataframe containing the `subject_id`, `chartdate`, and
    `concept` (CUI) corresponding to each True value in the nx_terms dataframe.

    IMPLEMENTATION INSTRUCTIONS:
        - Return a dataframe containing the `subject_id`, `chartdate`, and `concept`
            (CUI) corresponding to each True value in the nx_terms dataframe.
        - Do not modify the input dataframes.

    EXAMPLE:
        Lets say that the terms_df dataframe contains a row for a note where the
            column "heart attack" is True. If the CUI for "heart attack" is
            "C0018799", then the resulting dataframe should contain a row that
            contains the subject_id for the note, the chartdate for the note, and
            the CUI "C0018799".

    HINTS:
        - You can use the melt method to reshape the nx_terms dataframe from wide
            to long format. Check out the documentation for more information:

def get_note_concept_features(concept_df: pd.DataFrame):
    """
    Creates a patient level feature matrix that summarizes which concepts were
    found in each note as a binary feature matrix. Each row represents a patient
    and each column represents a concept. A value of 1 indicates that the concept
    was found in at least one note for the patient and a value of 0 indicates that
    the concept was not found in any notes for the patient.

    EXAMPLE:
        If concept_df contains rows that link the subject_id 1 to the ONLY the
        concepts C0018799 and C0007222, then the resulting dataframe should contain
        a row for subject_id 1 with a 1 in the columns for C0018799 and C0007222

    HINT: Your implemetation should utilize the pivot_table method, which has a
    argument that allows you to specify an aggregation function to use.

    IMPLEMENTATION INSTRUCTIONS:
        - Return a dataframe containing the patient level feature matrix that
            summarizes which concepts were found in each note as a binary feature
            matrix.

    "In this assignment, you will work with a dataset that we have prepared for you using a process similar to what you did in A3 and A4. The dataset describes patients from the [MIMIC III database](https://mimic.physionet.org/mimictables/patients/) who were put on mechanical ventilation and were stable for 12 hours. Some of these patients then experienced a sudden and sustained drop in oxygenation, while others did not. You will practice using common time-saving tools in the **Pandas 🐼** library, the **NumPy 🔢** library, the **sklearn 🔬** library, and **Python 🐍** programming language that are ideally suited to these tasks."

    "Hypothesis testing is a cornerstone of statistical inference, allowing researchers to determine if there's enough evidence in a sample of data to infer that a particular condition holds for a larger population. In biomedical data science, this method is essential for validating the significance of findings, be it in clinical trials, genomic studies, or other investigations. If you are unfamiliar with hypothesis testing, we recommend that you review the following video: [StatsQuest - Hypothesis Testing](https://youtu.be/0oc49DyA3hU)"

    "### Types of Hypothesis Tests\n",
    "#### Tests for one random variable\n",
    "- Continuous\n",
    "    **One-sample t-test:**: If you want to test if the mean of a single sample is different from a specified value (usually a known mean).\n",
    "- Discrete\n",
    "    **Chi-squared ($\\chi^2$) test:** Tests if the proportion of categorical outcomes is equal to a specified value.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Tests for two random variables\n",
    "- One continuous variable vs one discrete variable with 2 levels $^*$\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **For independent samples: Two-sample t-test:** *aka independent t-test*, used to determine whether there is a statistically significant difference between the means of two independent groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **For independent but small samples: Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test:** used to determine whether two independent samples come from the same distribution. (non-parametric alternative to the two-sample t-test)\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **For paired samples: Paired t-test:** *aka dependent t-test*, used to determine if there is a statistically significant mean difference between two sets of paired or related observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **For paired but small samples: Wilcoxon signed-rank test:** used to determine whether two dependent samples come from the same distribution. (non-parametric alternative to the paired t-test)\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "- One continuous variable vs one discrete variable with > 2 levels $^*$\n",
    "    - **One-way ANOVA**: used to determine whether there are any statistically significant differences between the means of three or more independent (unrelated) groups.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- One discrete variable vs one discrete variable\n",
    "    - **For r-level vs c-level: r x c contingency table Chi-squared test for independence:** used to determine if there's an association or relationship between two categorical variables where one variable has r levels and the other has c levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **For 2-level vs 2-level but small counts: Fisher's exact test:** similar to the Chi-squared test for a 2x2 contingency table, but used when the sample sizes are small (usually when the expected count/frequency in any cell of the table is less than 5)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - **For paired samples - McNemar's test:** used for 2x2 contingency tables with paired or matched data. A classic example is when patients are observed before and after a treatment, and the response is dichotomous (e.g., \"improved\" or \"not improved\").\n",
    "\n",
    "- One continuous variable vs one continuous variable:\n",
    "    - **Correlation/simple linear regression:** used to determine if there is a relationship between two continuous variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Tests for more than two random variables\n",
    "- One discrete vs one discrete vs one continuous:\n",
    "    - **Two-way ANOVA:** used to determine whether there are any statistically significant differences between the means of three or more independent (unrelated) groups that have been split on two factors (i.e., independent variables).\n",
    "    \n",
    "    <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- One continuous vs many - **multiple linear regression**\n",

Additionally, the large sample size (df=3463) makes the t-test fairly robust to violations of normality due to the Central Limit Theorem, making it a valid choice for comparing these two groups' means.</span>"

    "Generally, when we perform hypothesis tests, we are attempting to determine if a particular effect or difference is statistically significant. We usually use a significance level, often denoted as α (alpha), to make this determination. A common choice for α is 0.05, meaning that there is a 5% chance of incorrectly rejecting the null hypothesis (a Type I error) when it is actually true.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, when we conduct multiple hypothesis tests simultaneously – for example, when we are testing multiple variables or conditions at once – the likelihood of encountering at least one Type I error (i.e., finding at least one \"significant\" result when there actually is none) increases with the number of tests. This phenomenon is due to the accumulated risk from each individual test.\n",

    "To apply the correction, simply divide the desired α level by the number of tests being performed. For example, if we are performing 20 tests and want to maintain an overall α level (significance threshold) of 0.05, we would use an adjusted α level of 0.05/20 = 0.0025 for each individual test.\n",

Survival analysis is a powerful tool that can be used to answer a wide range of application areas, such as in clinical trials (to compare distributions of various treatment groups), epidemilogical studies (to identify risk factors that may influence the time to event prediction), and even patient monitoring (to predict the time to a equipment failure or a patient's discharge).\n",

    "### `2.3.2` (`13 points`) Kaplan-Meier Curves\n",
    "\n",
    "In survival analysis, an extremely commonly utilized tool is the `Kaplan-Meier (KM) estimator`, and the associated visualization method, the `Kaplan-Meier curve`. The `Kaplan-Meier (KM) estimator` is a non-parametric* method used to estimate the `survival function` from time-to-event data, which is the probability that a particular event has not occurred yet at a given time point. The `Kaplan-Meier curve` is a graphical representation of the `survival function` over time, and is often used to compare the survival distributions of different groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this part of the assignment, you will set up a function to generate a `Kaplan-Meier curve` for the cohort's data. You will then use the `Kaplan-Meier curve` to compare the survival distributions of patients who experienced a sudden drop in oxygenation (oxy_drop) to those who did not. Before we get started, let's learn a bit more about how the `Kaplan-Meier estimator` works.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `Kaplan-Meier estimator` is a product-limit estimator, meaning that it is calculated as the product of the conditional probabilities of surviving each time interval. At each time point in our data, we need to know the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $n_i$ = The number of patients who are at risk of experiencing the event at time $t_i$\n",
    "- $d_i$ = The number of patients who experienced the event at time $t_i$\n",
    "\n",
    "The `Kaplan-Meier estimator` for the survival function at time $t_i$ is calculated as the product of the probabilities for all observed time points up to and including $t_i$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\hat{S}(t_i) = \\prod_{j: t_j \\leq t_i} \\frac{n_j - d_j}{n_j} = \\prod_{j: t_j \\leq t_i} P(T > t_j | T > t_{j-1})$\n",
    "\n",
    "The `Kaplan-Meier curve` is a graphical representation of the `Kaplan-Meier estimator` over time. The `Kaplan-Meier curve` is a step function, where the value of the curve at each time point is equal to the value of the `Kaplan-Meier estimator` at that time point (with time on the x-axis and the `Kaplan-Meier estimator` on the y-axis).\n",
    "\n",
    "> \\* A \"non-parameteric\" method in statistics refers to a type of method that makes few (if any) assumptions about data. This contrasts with \"parametric\" methods which assume some sort of distributional form for the data. The Kaplan-Meier curve is a non-parametric method because it does not assume any particular distribution for the survival times, and **utilizes only the observed data to estimate the survival function.**"

    "### `2.3.3` (`7 points`) Cox Proportional Hazards Model\n",

    "Another fundamental tool of survival analysis is the `Cox Proportional Hazards Model`. The `Cox Proportional Hazards Model` is a semi-parametric* method used to model the `hazard function` from time-to-event data. The `hazard function` is the probability that a particular event occurs at a given time point, given that the event has not occurred yet. (Contrast the hazard function with the survival function we talked about above!)\n",
    "\n",
    "The `Cox Proportional Hazards Model` is a popular tool for survival analysis because it is relatively simple to implement, and it allows us to estimate the effect of multiple variables on the `hazard function` simultaneously.\n",

    "Let's see if we can more conclusively determine a causal effect of a sudden oxygenation drop on mortality using *matching* in our analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Matching** is a technique used to control for confounding variables in observational data by grouping units (e.g. individuals in a study) based on similar characteristics or propensities before estimating treatment effects. Matching is a popular technique in causal inference because it allows us to estimate the causal effect of a treatment on an outcome by comparing units that are similar in all aspects except for the treatment. \n",
    "\n",
    "> Note that sometimes \"matching\" is described as mechanism to \"mimic\" or \"emulate\" the randomization of a RCT. This interpretation is incorrect: matching is just a tool you can use to adjust for confounders in a non-randomized study, but does not introduce randomization.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, we will utilize `propensity scores` to perform a matching analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start with the definition: A `propensity score` is the probability that a unit (e.g. an individual in a study) was exposed to a particular **`treatment or exposure`** given their observed characteristics. So in our example, the propensity score of an individual patient is the probability that they had a sudden oxygenation drop (`oxy_drop` is 1) given their other features.\n",
    "\n",
    "A propensity score matching analysis involves the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Calculate the propensity scores for each unit in the dataset:\n",
    "    The first step in our process is to determine propensity scores for each unit in the dataset. In our example, we want to calculate the probability that a patient had a sudden oxygenation drop (`oxy_drop` is 1) given their other features. We can do this by fitting a logistic regression model of `oxy_drop` on the other features in the dataset (you do not including the outcome: `death_in_stay`). The predicted probabilities from this model are the propensity scores for each patient.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Match units based on their propensity scores:\n",
    "    There are multiple strategies to do this, but the idea is that patients who have similar propensity scores are likely to have similar characteristics, and therefore are likely to be comparable in terms of their potential outcomes. In our example, we will use a method called \"Caliper Matching\". We will discribe caliper matching in more detail in the sections below, and utilize it to match patients in the exposure group to patients in the control group (note that not all patients will be matched).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Run an analysis only utilizing patients that were matched in the previous step.\n",
    "\n",
    "Patients who have similar propensities are more \"twin-like\" and therefore more comparable in terms of their potential outcomes. If two patients have similar propensity scores and one of them was \"exposed\" while the other was not, we can be more confident that any difference in their outcomes is due to the exposure, rather than due to differences in their characteristics."

    "Now that we have fit our propensity model and have calculated our propensity scores, let's take a look at the distribution of propensity scores in our dataset. Rather than plotting the distribution of propensity scores themselves, we will plot the distirubtions of the logits of the propensity scores.\n",

    "Transformations (like the logit transformation) are often applied to sets of data to \"change the scale\", which can be really helpful for visualizing or interpreting distributions. In this case, we are using the logit transformation to \"re-scale\" the propensity scores (which are bounded between 0 and 1) to a range that is unbounded. Propensity scores close to 0 suggest a low probability of exposure, while scores close to 1 suggest a high probability of exposure. In some datasets, many scores can cluster near these boundaries, making it hard to visually assess overlap in the distributions. After applying the logit transformation, a propensity score of 0.5 is centered at 0, giving a much more normalized distribution. By transforming to logits, the scores that were clustered near 0 and 1 are spread out more evenly, making it easier to see the distribution of both groups and assess the overlap.\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary goal of propensity score methods in observational studies is to reduce confounding by making the treated and untreated groups comparable in terms of the observed covariates. If there's significant overlap in the logit-transformed scores, it indicates that there's a good chance of finding comparable treated and untreated observations for causal inference analysis."

By including a variable after exposure, we then would risk the post-exposure variable being associated with the exposure, and hence the association between exposure-outcome may be reduced/amplified based on post-exposure's association with exposure. Generally speaking, for causal inference we try to isolate the effect of exposure to outcome only, and hence time ordering of the variables is sensitive.</span>"

    """
    Performs a t-test on each column in the filtered_features dataframe
    whose name contains the column_substring to test it's association with
    the death_in_stay outcome. Returns a dataframe containing three columns:
    column_name, p_value, and a boolean column indicating whether the null
    hypothesis was rejected for that column when compared to a bonferroni
    corrected significance level, and returns a list containing the string
    column names of the features that were found to have a significant
    association with the death_in_stay outcome.

    IMPLEMENTATION INSTRUCTIONS:
        - Implement the function below where specified.
        - Perform a t-test on each column in the filtered_features dataframe
            whose name contains the column_substring.
        - Store the column name, p-value, and a boolean indicating whether the
            null hypothesis was rejected for that column in a dataframe.
        - The returned dataframe should have three columns:
            - column_name: The name of the column
            - p_value: The p-value of the t-test
            - reject_null: A boolean indicating whether the null hypothesis was
                rejected for that column when compared to a bonferroni corrected
                significance level.
        - Use the ttest_ind function from scipy.stats to perform the t-tests.
            (already imported for you)
        - Use a bonferroni corrected significance level of alpha / num_columns
            when determining whether to reject the null hypothesis for a column.
        - Do NOT modify the input dataframes.

    Parameters:
        filtered_features (pd.DataFrame): A dataframe containing the filtered
            features
        label_df (pd.DataFrame): A dataframe containing the labels
        column_substring (str): A substring that will be used to filter the
            columns to perform t-tests on
        alpha (float): The (uncorrected) significance level to use when determining
            whether to reject the null hypothesis for a column.

    Returns:
        ttest_results (pd.DataFrame): A dataframe containing the results of the
            t-tests
        sig_columns (List[str]): A list containing the string column names of the

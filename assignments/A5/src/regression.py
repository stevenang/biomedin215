):
    """
    Runs a logistic regression utilizing the statsmodels package formula api
    and returns the resulting fit model object.

    `statsmodels` is a powerful Python package for statistical modeling. It mimics
    the functionality of R, a popular statistical programming language. The
    `statsmodels.formula.api` (often imported as `smf`) provides a way to
    specify models using formula strings: strings the describe the relationship
    between variables to be used in a model, often in the following form:
        "outcome ~ feature_1 + feature_2 + ... + feature_n"

    To read about the formula api, see the following documentation:
        https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/example_formulas.html

    The formula API is particularly useful when working with Pandas DataFrames because
    it allows for a high-level concise way to define the relationships between variables.

    In this function, use the formula api to create a logistic regression model
    and fit it to the data.

    IMPLEMENTATION INSTRUCTIONS:
        - Implement the function below where specified.
        - Use the smf.glm function to create a logistic regression model. You
            will need to specify the following parameters:
            - `formula`: A string that specifies the relationship between features
                and the outcome using the formula api. Your implementation should
                call the function `create_formula_string` to create this string.
            - `data`: The dataframe containing the features and outcome. You should
                concatenate the labels and filtered_features dataframes into a single
                dataframe and use that as the data parameter.
            - `family`: The appropriate statistical family of the model (Think about
                what type of data we are working with/ what we are trying to predict)
        - Use the .fit() method to fit the model to the data, and return the result
            of the fit function call as the return value.
            - ei. result = glm.fit()
        - If selected_features is None, use all the features in the filtered_features
            dataframe in the formula. Otherwise, use only the features in the
            selected_features list.

    Parameters:
        filtered_features (pd.DataFrame): A dataframe containing the filtered
            features
        labels (pd.DataFrame): A dataframe containing the labels
        selected_features (List[str]): A list of column names to use as features.
            If None, use all the features in the filtered_features dataframe.

    Returns:
        result (statsmodels.genmod.generalized_linear_model.GLMResultsWrapper): The
            result of the fit function call

def create_formula_string(outcome_col: str, feature_col_list: List[str]) -> str:
    """
    Creates a (simple) formula string for use in the statsmodels formula api.

    The formula string should be of the form:
        "outcome ~ feature_1 + feature_2 + ... + feature_n"
    where outcome is the name of the outcome column, and feature_1 through
    feature_n are the names of the feature columns. (For the purposes of this
    assignment, we will only be using simple formula strings of this form.)

    IMPLEMENTATION INSTRUCTIONS:
        - Implement the function below where specified.
        - Create a formula string using the outcome_col and feature_col_list
            parameters.
        - Return the formula string.

    Parameters:
        outcome_col (str): The name of the outcome column
        feature_col_list (List[str]): A list of column names to use as features.

    Returns:
        formula_string (str): A string that specifies the relationship between
            features and the outcome using the formula api.

IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS:
    - Do NOT modify the function signatures of the functions in this file.
    - Only make changes inside the specified locations for your implementation.
    - You may add additional helper functions if you wish.

    Split the data into training and testing sets.

    IMPLEMENTATION INSTRUCTIONS:
        - Implement the function below in the specified location.
        - Set the random seed to the random_state parameter passed into this function.
        - Generate a permutation of indices for the data using np.random.permutation
        - Calculate num_test or the number of samples to include in the test set using
            the test_fraction parameter multiplied by the number of samples in the
            dataset. (rounded to the nearest integer)
        - Split the permutation of indicies into two lists:
            - test_indices: Contains the first num_test permutation indices
            - train_indices: Contains the remaining permutation indices
        - Use the test_indices to create the testing dataframes:
            - X_test: Contains the testing features
            - Y_test: Contains the testing labels
        - Use the train_indices to create the training dataframes:
            - X_train: Contains the training features
            - Y_train: Contains the training labels
        - Do NOT modify the input dataframes.

    Parameters:
        features (pd.DataFrame): dataframe containing the features for each sample
        labels (pd.DataFrame): dataframe containing the labels for each sample
        test_fraction (float): fraction of the total data to use for testing
        random_state (int): random state to use

    Returns:
        pd.DataFrame: dataframe containing the training features    (X_train)
        pd.DataFrame: dataframe containing the testing features     (X_test)
        pd.DataFrame: dataframe containing the training labels      (Y_train)
        pd.DataFrame: dataframe containing the testing labels       (Y_test)

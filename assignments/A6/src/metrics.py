def accuracy(test_labels: np.ndarray, test_predictions: np.ndarray) -> float:
    """
    Calculates the accuracy of the model's predictions given the true labels.

    Accuracy is defined as the fraction of predictions that are correct.
        acc = correct / total

    IMPLEMENTATION INSTRUCTIONS:
        - Implement the function below in the specified location.
        - You may use numpy to calculate the accuracy.

    Parameters:
        test_labels (np.ndarray): array containing the true labels
        test_predictions (np.ndarray): array containing the predicted labels

    Returns:
        float: accuracy of the model's predictions

def confusion_matrix(

) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Calculates the confusion matrix for the model's predictions given the true
    labels and returns the resulting 2x2 numpy array.

    The confusion matrix is defined as follows:
        - The rows correspond to the true labels
        - The columns correspond to the predicted labels
        - The entry at position (i, j) corresponds to the number of samples with
            true label i and predicted label j.

    IMPLEMENTATION INSTRUCTIONS:
        - Implement the function below in the specified location.
        - Return a 2x2 numpy array containing the confusion matrix as specified above.

    Parameters:
        test_labels (np.ndarray): array containing the true labels
        test_predictions (np.ndarray): array containing the predicted labels

    Returns:

def sensitivity(con_mat: np.ndarray) -> float:

    Calculates the sensitivity of the model's predictions given the confusion matrix.

    Sensitivity is defined as the fraction of positive samples that were correctly
    identified.
        sens = TP / (TP + FN)

    IMPLEMENTATION INSTRUCTIONS:
        - Implement the function below in the specified location.
        - Your implementation should return a 0 if the denominator is 0.
            - Ensure that no warning is raised in this case.

    Using LogisticRegression and GridSearchCV from sklearn, set up a cross validation.

    IMPLEMENTATION INSTRUCTIONS:
        - First create a LogisticRegression model object that:
            - Uses L2 regularization
            - Uses the solver `lbfgs`
            - Uses the parameter `random_state` passed into this function
            - Uses the parameter `max_iter` passed into this function
        - Then create a GridSearchCV object that:
            - Uses the LogisticRegression model object you created
            - Runs a cross validation with `k_folds` folds
            - Uses "roc_auc" as the scoring metric
            - Uses the parameter `n_jobs` set to -1
        - Fit the GridSearchCV object to the training data and return the resulting
            GridSearchCV object.

    Parameters:
        train_features: The training features as a Pandas DataFrame
        train_labels: The training labels as a NumPy ndarray
        k_folds: The number of folds to use in cross validation
        lambdas: The list of lambda values to use in cross validation
        random_state: The random seed to use when training the model
        max_iter: The maximum number of iterations to use when training the model

    Returns:
        log_reg_cv: The GridSearchCV object

    Display the partial dependence plots for a model.

    This function uses the PartialDependenceDisplay function from sklearn to
    display the partial dependence plots for a model. The partial dependence
    plots show the relationship between the features and the predicted
    probability of death in the hospital.

    IMPLEMENTATION INSTRUCTIONS:
        - Implement the function below in the specified location.
        - You should only need to write a few lines of code in this function.
            - Hint: Look at the documentation for PartialDependenceDisplay:
                https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.inspection.PartialDependenceDisplay.html
        - Do NOT modify the input dataframes.

    Parameters:
        model: The model to use to generate the partial dependence plots
        features: The features to use to generate the partial dependence plots
        feature_names: The names of the features to use to generate the partial
            dependence plots. This should be a list of strings or a list of tuples
            of strings.
        filename: The name of the file to save the plot to. If this is None, the
            plot will not be saved to a file.

    labels: pd.DataFrame,

):
    """
    Display the distribution of ages in the dataset split by whether or not
    the patient died in the hospital.

    IMPLEMENTATION INSTRUCTIONS:
        - Implement the function below in the specified location.
        - You should only need to write a few lines of code in this function.
            - Hint: Look at the documentation for seaborn:
                https://seaborn.pydata.org/generated/seaborn.histplot.html
        - Create a histogram of the ages of the patients in the dataset split
            by whether or not the patient died in the hospital.
            - Feel free to add additional parameters to the histogram if you
                wish!
        - Save the plot to the file specified by `filename` if `filename` is
            not None.
        - Do NOT modify the input dataframes.

    Parameters:
        features: The features to use to generate the partial dependence plots
        labels: The labels to use to generate the partial dependence plots
        filename: The name of the file to save the plot to. If this is None, the
            plot will not be saved to a file.

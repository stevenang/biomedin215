def calc_roc_curve(

    test_probabilites: np.ndarray,
) -> Tuple[np.ndarray, np.ndarray]:
    """
    Calculates the TPR and FPR values that up the ROC curve for a model's predictions
    given the true labels and predicted probabilites. Returns two numpy arrays
    containing the FPR and TPR values for the ROC curve.

    TPR is the true positive rate, also known as sensitivity or recall.

    FPR is the false positive rate, which is defined as 1 - specificity.

    IMPLEMENTATION INSTRUCTIONS:
        - Implement the function below in the specified location.
        - Your implementation should calculate the FPR and TPR for 1000 equally
            spaced threshold values between 0 and 1.
            - HINT: You may find the np.linspace function useful.
            - HINT: You may find it helpful to use some functions you implemented
                in the metrics.py file! They have been imported for you.
        - Return the resulting FPR and TPR values as numpy arrays.
            - The FPR and TPR values should be ordered in increasing order of the
                threshold values. (So the FPRs and TPRs corresponding to the
                smallest threshold values should be at the beginning of the arrays,
                and the FPRs and TPRs corresponding to the largest threshold values
                should be at the end of the arrays.)

    Parameters:
        test_labels (np.ndarray): array containing the true labels
        test_probabilities (np.ndarray): array containing the probabilites of each example
        filename (str): filename to save the plot to

    Returns:
        np.ndarray: array containing the FPR values
        np.ndarray: array containing the TPR values

    Displays a plot that contains a ROC curve for each pair of FPR and TPR arrays

    IMPLEMENTATION INSTRUCTIONS:
        - Implement the function below in the specified location.
        - For each pair of FPR and TPR arrays in the fpr_tpr_list, plot the ROC
            on the same plot with a different color.
        - Using seaborn, your ROC plot should contain the following attributes:
            - The x-axis should be the FPR
            - The y-axis should be the TPR
            - The plot should also contain a diagonal line to represent random
                performance.
            - A legend should be included to indicate which ROC curve corresponds
                to which model.
        - Save the plot to a png file with the given filename if it is not None.

    Parameters:

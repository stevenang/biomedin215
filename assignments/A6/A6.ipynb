A virtual environment is a self-contained directory that contains a Python interpreter (aka Python installation) and any additional packages/modules that are required for a specific project. It allows you to isolate your project's dependencies from other projects that may have different versions or requirements of the same packages.\n",

    "In this course, we require that you utilize [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) to manage your virtual environments. Miniconda is a lightweight version of [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/), a popular Python distribution that comes with many of the packages that are commonly used in data science."

    "### Data Description üìÇ\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, you will work with a dataset that we have prepared for you using a process similar to what you did in previous homeworks. The dataset describes patients from the [MIMIC III database](https://mimic.physionet.org/mimictables/patients/) who were put on mechanical ventilation and were stable for 12 hours. Some of these patients then experienced a sudden and sustained drop in oxygenation, while others did not. You will practice using common time-saving tools in the **Pandas üêº** library and **Python üêç** programming language that are ideally suited to these tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have recorded a variety of features about each patient before the 12-hour mark (the index time), including counts of all prior diagnoses (aggregated with IC), all respiratory-related concepts in their notes, and indicators of events recorded in the patient charts. Indicator features are the number of times each event was recorded in the patient record, regardless of what the measured value was. For those chart events which have numeric values associated with them (e.g. lab tests) we found those in which a value was recorded for over 85% of the cohort and included the latest recorded value of those features. In addition, we have included demographic features (age and sex). For the small number of patients who did not have one or more of those features recorded, we used column-mean imputation to impute them. We also recorded whether or not each patient went on to experience a sudden and sustained drop in their oxygenation (the exposure). Finally, we recorded whether or not each patient eventually died during their hospitalization (the outcome). All of this data is contained in `patient_feature_matrix.csv`. \n",

    "The companion file `feature_descriptions.csv` has descriptions of each of the features and their provenance. \n",

Increasingly, EHR schemas are updated/designed to capture SIGI in addition to biological sex to improve care for transgender and gender nonconforming (TGNC) patients.\n",

It consists of input-output pairs where the inputs are the features or predictors, and the outputs are the labels or targets the model aims to predict. During the training phase, the model learns to recognize patterns or mappings from inputs to outputs. The quality and diversity of the training data are crucial, as they determine the model's ability to generalize to new, unseen data.\n",

The `validation` set is used to assess the performance of the model on unseen data during the training phase, and is used to tune the hyperparameters of the model. By creating a `validation` set, the `test` set can be reserved to only be utilized to evaluate the final performance of the model after the training phase is complete. \n",

    "\n",
    "Regularization is a fundamental concept in machine learning and statistics, particularly in the context of regression and classification problems. It involves adding a penalty to the loss function that the algorithm is trying to minimize. The primary goal of regularization is to prevent overfitting, which occurs when a model learns the training data too well, including the noise, and performs poorly on unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many different types of regularization, but the two most common types are `L1` and `L2` regularization. Let's talk a bit more about these:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `L1` Regularization\n",
    "\n",
    "Also known as `Lasso` regularization, `L1` regularization adds a penalty term to the loss function that is proportional to the sum of the absolute values of the coefficients of the model:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ Penalty(\\lambda) = \\lambda \\sum_{j=1}^{p} |\\beta_{j}|$\n",
    "\n",
    "In the equation above, $\\beta_j$ are the coefficients of the model, while $\\lambda$ is a hyper-parameter that controls how much the penalty term impacts the total loss. When $\\lambda = 0$, the penalty term has no effect, and the lasso model reduces to a standard linear regression model. As $\\lambda$ increases, and the regularization's impact on the total loss becomes greater.\n",
    "\n",
    "L1 regularization induces `sparsity`, which means that it encourages as many coefficients in the model to be 0 as possible. L1 regularization is often beneficial in contexts where feature selection is important, as it simplifies the model by retaining the parameters that correspond to only the most important features.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `L2` Regularization\n",
    "\n",
    "Also known as `Ridge` regularization, `L2` regularization adds a penalty term to the loss function that is proportional to the sum of the squared values of the coefficients of the model:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ Penalty(\\lambda) = \\lambda \\sum_{j=1}^{p} \\beta_{j}^2$\n",
    "\n",
    "Like in the equation for `L1` regularization, $\\beta_j$ are the coefficients of the model, while $\\lambda$ is a hyper-parameter that controls how much the penalty term impacts the total loss. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since L2 regularization penalizes the squared values of the coefficients, it discourages individual coefficients from becoming very large. This results in a model with smaller, more evenly distributed coefficient values. This can help stabilize the estimation, especially in the presence of highly correlated features. "

However, it struggles significantly with detecting patients who will experience the outcome (class 1), shown by the low sensitivity of 0.24. This means the model only correctly identifies 24% of the actual positive cases - missing about 76% of patients who will experience the outcome.\n",
    "2. The precision of 0.52 for class 1 indicates that when the model predicts a positive outcome, it's only correct about half the time. This suggests a high rate of false alarms. The significant class imbalance in the dataset is evident from the support numbers: 557 negative cases versus only 134 positive cases (roughly a 4:1 ratio). This imbalance likely contributes to the model's poor performance on the minority class.\n",

The confusion matrix reveals that while the model correctly identified 529 true negatives (patients who survived), it missed 102 positive cases (false negatives) - patients who experienced the outcome but weren't identified by the model.

However, in our case, while the test set shows high overall accuracy, this metric is misleading due to the model's poor sensitivity despite high specificity. This means our model struggles to identify patients at risk of mortality during admission - a crucial limitation for practical clinical applications. This performance disparity largely stems from the significant class imbalance in our training data, where negative cases (survivors) vastly outnumber positive cases (non-survivors).<br/><br/>To address this, we could implement oversampling techniques (like SMOTE) exclusively on the training data to balance the classes during model learning. By keeping the test set unchanged, we maintain its representation of real-world distributions while potentially improving the model's ability to detect positive cases. This approach might help achieve better sensitivity without sacrificing specificity, providing a more clinically useful model when evaluated on the original, imbalanced test set.</span>"
